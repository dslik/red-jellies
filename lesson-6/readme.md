# Lesson 6 Assignment

## Final Project Planning

Review the final project instructions. Put together a preliminary rough draft of your final report. This is intended to be a planning exercise, not that you should have your project complete (though it makes the report easier to write if you put it in present/past tense instead of putting in “should” and “shall”).
As you work through the draft final report, note where you might have trouble. Make a list of the tasks you want to complete for the project. Make a list of the minimum viable project and any blocking items (unacquired hardware, difficulty with toolchains).
Include any relevant pieces from past assignments (such as the state machine documentation from Exercise 5).
