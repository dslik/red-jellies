# Lesson 2 Assignments

## Exercise 2.1: Idea Project Diagram

Make a block diagram describing an embedded system you’d like to have or make. Be imaginative. Reality does not apply here.

## Assignment Submission

The below hardware block diagram is a refined version of the one in my [Lesson 1 assignment submission](https://github.com/dslik/red-jellies/blob/main/lesson-1/assignment.md):

While it is unlikely that I would be able to build this entire device due to a combination of significant technical challenges and my current skill level, the µP subsystem is likely achievable.

## Exercise 2.2: Read mbed code, make diagram

* Go to mbed platforms https://os.mbed.com/platforms/
* Select any platform (hint: search for a processor similar to the one you are considering
for your final project)
* Read through the platform page
* Add to Mbed Compiler (button on right)
* Load a simple sounding template
* Create a block diagram for this program, briefly explain why you chose the platform
and template you did, be prepared to talk about this board in Live Class
