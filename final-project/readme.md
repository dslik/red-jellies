## Final Project Deliverables

The final project will be delivered as:

(a) Video of the system working as intended (link to mp4 or youtube)
(b) Write up of the system (PDF or Google docs report).
(c) Link to the code

Bonus points are available by including one of these:

* An analysis of the power used in the system (expected vs actual)
* Implementation of firmware update with a description in the report of how it works
* A description of profiling the system to make it run faster

Additional bonus points are available by having a version control history showing the development process
